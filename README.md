# 🎬 Movie Reviews API
A secure REST API for discovering movies and managing user reviews — built with Django & Django REST Framework.

## 🌟 What is this?
The Movie Reviews API combines external data from the **OMDb API** with user-generated reviews. Users can search movies, view details, and create/update/delete their own reviews.

Perfect for:
- Building a React/Vue/mobile frontend for movies
- Learning how to integrate external APIs with Django REST Framework
- Creating a foundation for review-based applications

## ✨ Key Features
- User Authentication (JWT-based)
- Search movies via OMDb API
- View detailed movie information
- Create, update, and delete personal reviews
- Per-user review management (users can only edit/delete their own reviews)
- Clean RESTful API structure
